TLDR: My 2022 note taking workflow mainly consists of obsidian and vscode because of their minimalist, yet expandable feature set. On the side, I use apple notes to take quick notes that can be syncronized on my phone and laptop.

# Note Taking
![](https://s2.loli.net/2022/11/07/O3y5CoFkgRA8p1D.jpg)
I have an obsession with setting up the perfert workflow, and part of that workflow is my note taking environment. I have tried and tested many note taking applications out there in order to set up the best, most suitable and most comfortable note-taking environment for me. There are a lot of note taking applications out there, ranging from minimalist, quick notes to all-in-one tools, and I will share my take on some of these notes. Obviously, this is not an in depth review on each application, but just my takeaways from using each app. Then I would like to show you my current workflow in 2022.

> Everybody has their own style of note taking. This is simply what I use.

## Google Docs
### *What drawed me in?*
[Google Docs](google-docs) allows you to "create, edit, and collaborate on online documents". I guess I can't say I was "drawn" into google notes, instead, it was the de-facto note taking device throughout Highschool. I would take notes with it with my friends, and I could access those notes wherever. It was simple to use.

### *Why do I no longer use Google Docs?*
There are a few reasons. The first one is its document management system. I believe that a good note taking workflow should allows you to manage a lot of files, and be able to transition between multiple files, as well as view multiple documents at once. It quickly becomes unmanageble. Secondly, I no longer needed to "collaborate on online" documents. A large portion of my notes were for myself, and I didn't like that accessing notes required a good internet connection. So I started to stray away from "oneline" note taking applications, and moved toward notes that could be stored locally.

## Notion
![](https://s2.loli.net/2022/11/07/eKO9a42tclYGgoQ.png)

### *What drawed me in?*
[Notion](notion) describes itself as in "all-in-one workspace for your notes, task, wikis, and database". What drawed me in to trying Notion was is customization. Just looking at [templates](notion-templates) offered by notion themselves, and notion templates designed by other users, its hard not to be attracted by its pretty UI and large array of features. I loved tinkering with its database management features. Notion can create dynamic, interconnected notes, having complex interactive block elements, ranging from calendars, tables, and lists. I also like its ability to share notes quickly by sharing a link, yet still saves notes locally. I have used Notion in highschool and tried picking it up again in college, but soon found it a hassle to use it after a couple weeks both times.

### *Why do I no longer use Notion?*
Every advantage has a liabiltiy, and I think that's what drove me away from Notion. Notion is extremely customizable, and I think one would have to experience it for themselves to understand. But, for a note taking device, I think it was *too* customizable. I often found myself spending a lot of time configuring my notes, even for a single page, perhaps because of my procastination superpower, but also because of the enourmous set of features it offered (most of which I never got to use). And, I spent a lot of time trying to create a "pretty" note, or setting Notion up to replace other applications (such as task mangement, todo list, or calendar). Perhaps its simply a steep learning curve, but to me, creating the perfect note taking workflow isn't about creating the most elegant notes, its about what you want to write notes. Both times I stopped using Notion was because of these extra, non essential features. 

Another thing is about its bloated UI. To me, I like my notes compact, and I just thought Notion had a lot of "extra space" in both its main note taking page area and its general layout. For example, I believe the header of each page takes up way too much space, and I believe its often uncessary, who needs an image and header for every note that you take? 

In short, Notion offers too much for me.

### *Other applications similar to Notion*
- [Evernote](ever-note)

## Typora
![](https://s2.loli.net/2022/11/07/wmGrkbR8caN4Pet.png) 
### *What drawed me in?*
One word, [Markdown](markdown). I was first introduced into markdown as I began my programming journey. I instantly fell in love with it. It's simplicty is exactly what I wanted in note taking. Compared to the likes of Microsoft Word or Google Docs, [Typora](typora) minmalist writing editor format, and markdown's simple syntax is the perfect combination. 

Typora has everything you need in a simplistic note taking application. No uncessary formating, no complex features, just note taking. It isnt to say typora isn't powerful. It supports HTML, latex, and themes. Yeah, you can do basically anything. It also has a folder view, in which you can quickly switch between files without using an file explorer.

### *Why do I no longer use Typora?*
There are three main reasons. First, the paywall. In beta mode, typora was free, but, then in November 23rd, 2021, its official version came out, but with a steep cost. The second is its file management system. It is better than google docs, allowing you to view files in the current folder that you are working in, but you have to implement this hiearchy of notes manually. This leads into my last reason. Notes shouldn't be confined to this strict hierarchy. Notes should be intertwined, easily reused, and easily accessible. But at the time, that was the only method I knew, until I came across [Obsidian](obsidian).

## One-Note

### *What drawed me in?*
Using a surface (2 in one laptop) in highschool, this again was another de-facto noting application. It is advertized as a "cross-functional notebook for all your notetaking needs". It supports handwriting, where each page is essentially an paper of infinite size. 

### *Why do I no longer use OneNote?*
I simply found this style of note taking too messy in the long run. But, I did like the "endless" canvas design, which is extremely helpful in creating visual notes diagrams, flowcharts, etc. However, creating diagrams by hand is often messy (as I am not an artist), so if the diagrams were complex, it was a hassle. As a computer science major, with courses in computer architecture, software engineering, operating systems, computer graphics, and more, designs could be extremely complex, and OneNote wasn't good enough. Also, I didn't really like the microsoft office ecosystem anymore.

## Notability
![](https://s2.loli.net/2022/11/07/CJ3k2tgLqwi5euR.png)
### *What drawed me in?*
As I switched from a Surface to and iPad in college, this became my daily driver for handwritten notes. For me, electronic handwritten notes have one advantage over traditional pen and paper, which is its ability to erase easily, and create colored visualization. For math/physics related homework, I found this aspect extremely helpful for handwritten homework submissions and to use as scratchwork. Using it to view and annotate pdfs was simple too. Like OneNote, you could use it to create small visualizations/diagrams. 

### *Why do I no longer use Notability?*
As far as electronic handwriting technology has improved, I still prefered using pen and paper to take notes, scratchwork, etc. I simply found myself using the iPad and Notability less and less. Thus, I sold my iPad, and returned to traditional note taking. For diagrams, I began to use [Excalidraw](excalidraw). 

# Workflow in 2022
So what do I use now? I actually use a combination of applications to take my notes, including
- [Obsidian](obsidian)
- Apple Notes
- [Visual Studio Code](vscode)
- [Excalidraw](excalidraw)

## Obsidian
![](https://s2.loli.net/2022/11/07/euS75UZHzQBFTxb.png)
[Obsidian](obsidian) advertises itself as a "powerful knowledge base on top of a local folder" of markdown files. It claims to be a "second brain", organizing notes in a non-linear fasion, where all ideas and concepts are interconnected through backlinks. Notes can be written and easily reused. Obsidian covers almost all the disadvantages that I listed above, and yet it is still extremely simple at its core. Here are the reasons why I like obsidian.
### Local, Centralized File Storage
All notes are stored in a "vault", in which you can have many, but I use one. All my notes are stored here, and stored locally. The app allows you to open and search for any note inside the application, which makes switching between notes extremely easily. It supports tabs, allowing you to view notes side by side if required. Yet, since all apps are stored in a central location, syncing this vault, which is essentially a giant folder, is quite easy. There are a lot of applications that allow you to sync automatically. 
### Markdown
Since all notes are in markdown, this makes the notes independt of Obsidian, which makes the notes both portable, and shareable. 
### Cross Linking and Backlinking
![](https://s2.loli.net/2022/11/07/LgdVklNn4pKevDE.jpg)
Note taking applications such as Google Docs and Typora, notes are seperated by file, and thus often linear. That means you can often find yourself rewriting the same notes over and over again when reviewing a subject or learning a new subject that builds upon concepts you have learned, but want to review. Like wikipedia, which links keyterms to other pages, Obsidian allows you to link notes together. For example, if I am taking notes on a new neural network architecture, but uses previously learned activation function that I have already taken notes on before, I can simply link the old note to this new one, and can easily jump between both. This makes jumping between notes seamless. Most applications, like `Typora`, you would have to open a new folder and possible a new window to view an old note. This is an extra hassle which we shouldn't need to deal with.

### UI: Live Preview and Flexible Layout
To some, writing strictly in markdown may not be the most pleasnt experience. Images are shown as links, tables aren't aligned, and just the general markdown syntax is shown. Like `Typora`, obsidian supports live preview mode, which basically renders markdown on the spot, and allows you to show images, formatted syntax (like headers, highlights, lists, tables) on the spot. Here is the difference live preiview (left) and source mode (right).
![](https://s2.loli.net/2022/11/07/fIKd6WS1vphGcyQ.png)
This also shows Obsidian's flexible layout, allowing you not only to open multiple tabs at once but view notes side by side in one application. 
### Simple, but Customizable
Obsidian is extremely simple at its core: a markdown editor with a great file linking design. However, obsidian is also extremely customizable. There are a lot of open-source community plugins which can be added to expand obsidans default functionality. There are also various themes to change the default look of obsidian. Obsidian always offers a lot of keybindings/shortcuts, which means that I don't have to use the mouse to switch between documents.

If you would like to see which plugins I currently use as well as my favorite theme, leave a comment, and perhaps I'll do a post just on my Obsidian workflow. 

## Vscode
![](https://s2.loli.net/2022/11/07/VqUEKI2xzRuDJBh.png)
So why would I include [Visual Studio Code](vscode), a well known IDE for programmers, as a note taking device? Well, thats just it, I am a programmer, and that vscode can be seen as a glorified text editor. 

A good programmer needs to practice writing code. And with obsidian, you simply can't do that. Thus, I often have visual studio open, writing and testing code as I learn new topics and concepts. Thus, sometimes, it is more practical to write my notes directly into a coding file as comments, instead of migrating the code into Obsidian, and adding notes there. If I need to write documentation or reports for programming projects, then I would definitely do it directly in vscode. In fact, I am writing this blog in vscode :). However, I still prefer to take general notes in obsidian mainly because of two reasons. Firstly, I still prefer obsidian's file linking and file switching for note taking. Secondly, Obsidian's live preview. In vscode, in order to preview your markdown file, you have to open two tabs, one for the source and one for the preview, kind of like this.
![](https://s2.loli.net/2022/11/07/Us2HJgrF3R8KfPh.png)

But I do love vscode's zen mode for taking programming and writing, which removes all distractions of buttons, tabs, etc, which aren't always needed, and take up precious screen space.

Perhaps there is a way of integrating these two applications together more efficiently? If anyone has a way leave a comment below, I would love to know! I will also like to do a post on taking markdown notes in vscode in the future. 

## Apple Notes
![](https://s2.loli.net/2022/11/07/5P8tIZcAM7jWe2q.png)
I use apple notes to jot down simple, quick notes that can be easily synced across my laptop and phone. I don't use it as a full-fleged note taking application, but just for temporary drafts, ideas, or snippets of information.

## Other Tools
### Github
I do prefer having my notes stored locally, and since I usually do everything on one device anyways, I usually don't need to have my notes stored in the cloud. But, syncing is an important tool. It not only allows you to access your notes anywhere, but also allows you to keep a copy of your notes just in case your machine fails. 

Since obsidian's "vault" is basically a folder, I turned it into a github repository and periodically push my notes to a private repository. Thus, if I ever do need to access the notes elsewhere, I can go directly to my github repository, or simply clone/fork the repository from another device. Another plus about using git, is that I can view older versions of notes much more easily than simply syncing using Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.

Github is a whole another tool in itself, go to https://github.com/ to learn more.

### Picgo
Although markdown is indeed portable, sharing markdown documents with images is quite a hassle. Since markdown generates images by linking its path relative to the markdown document, you have to move the image (or change the path) whenever you move the documents/share the document. This is a hassle sometimes. In Obsidian, pasting an image from clipboard automatically saves the images to an `.assets` folder in the vault (all images go there), and links the image in markdown notation. 

For example, sometimes I write my project reports in obsidian, and sometimes have screenshots to show my results. If I were to migrate that markdown file into my project directory, the iamge links would be broken. Thus, I would either just export it as pdf, and submit only a pdf version, or I would have to move all the images over. Thus, this introduces [Picgo](https://picgo.github.io), a free and open source image management system that allows you to upload images in your clipboard to a storage device, then automatically copies the link to the online image. Thus, when writing documents, you are inserting a link to an online image, which suddenly makes this markdown file more portable than before. (I am assuming the professor viewing your submitted report does have internet connection). It is a tool I recently discovered, and I thought it was perfect. Also, now I don't need to store all my screenshots locally, which even saves up more space!

### Exceledraw
Good for creating diagrams, flow charts, etc. A plus is its handwritten style of creating objects. Draw.io is also a good alternative.


# A Perfect Workflow
As of 2022, my system consists of Obsidian for general note taking, Visual Studio Code for programming note taking, and Apple Notes for quick, short notes. I then use Github for syncing and backing up my notes. Again, I have only scratched the surface of these application. You should try them for yourself! Oh yeah, and they are completely free to download and use!

Right now, this setup suit all my needs. But, there is always room for improvement. I think I will always use something like apple notes, which is perfect for quick notes and syncs across devices. However, I do think using obsidian and vscode together is sometimes a hassle. As a programmer, I think I will always be using vscode. Thus if vscode gets the following Obsidian functionalities, I think I could completely cut out Obsidan from my note taking workflow.
- Live Preview Editing (don't want to open two tabs just to see preview) 
- Live Preview Themes
- Better File linking system (markdown does have extension to use `[[]]`, but isn't to level of obsidian)

That is it for now! Thanks for reading.
