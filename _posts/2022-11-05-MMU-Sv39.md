# The Memory Management Unit
From the perspective of most apps (that is, app developers), they monopolize the entire CPU and specific (continuous or discontinuous) memory space. For the sake of fairness, we rarely let exclusive CPUs happen. Therefore, the application's own exclusive CPU is just an illusion that the kernel wants the application to see, with appropriate abstraction is hidden and invisible to the application. Basically, to each application, "they each have their own memory and cpu", however, in the eyes of the OS kernel, this is known as virtual memory (adress).

If the application were to directly access physical address, some of the following problems would occur. 
1. The applications would need to plan the address it needs to be loaded to run at the time of construction. In order to avoid conflict, it may also require app developers to negotiate this, which is obviously an unreasonable. 
2. The kernel does not protect the access behavior of the application, and each application has the right to read and write the whole piece of physical memory. Even if the application is limited to running at the U privilege level, it can still cause a lot of trouble: for example, it can read and write data from other applications to steal information or disrupt its normal operation; it can even modify the code snippets of the kernel to replace the original trap_handler to hold the kernel. Execute malicious code. In short, this makes the system both unsafe and unstable.
3. The memory use space of the application is limited before it runs, and the kernel cannot flexibly provide the runtime dynamically available memory space to the application. For example, after an application is finished, the space occupied by the application is released, but this space cannot be dynamically used by other applications that are still in operation.

Therefore, in order to prevent application from beinghaved, we would need a method to better manage physical memory and provide the application with an abstracted, more transparent, easy-to-use and secure access memory interface, which is virtual memory based on the paging mechanism. From the perspective of application operation, there is a very large readable/writeable/executable address space starting from the "0" address. Here we discuss important aspects of the RISCV MMU implementation.

## Paging
Paging is a system by which a piece of hardware, commonly known as MMU, that translates virtual addresses into physical addresses. The translation is performed by reading a privileged register called the SATP or Supervisor Address Translation and Protection register. This register turns the MMU on/off, sets the address space identifier, and sets the physical memory address where the first page table can be found. It's quite important!
