# The Memory Management Unit

![MMU](https://s2.loli.net/2022/11/05/TDNbircV8np456Q.png)

## Paging
Paging is a system by which a piece of hardware (commonly referred to as the Memory Management Unit or MMU) translates virtual addresses into physical addresses. The translation is performed by reading a privileged register called the SATP or Supervisor Address Translation and Protection register. This register turns the MMU on/off, sets the address space identifier, and sets the physical memory address where the first page table can be found.
