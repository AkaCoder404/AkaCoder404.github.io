## Whoami

### *The Past*
My start in the field of computer science was quite late. I took my first computer science course in my junior year of high school. It was a standard computer science course taught in Java. The course itself was pretty simple, covering Java syntax, object oriented design, data structures, and algorithms. Here, I found one of my passions, not the course itself (whose emphesis is on programming), but the concept of using programming as a tool to develop software/hardware that can make my life easier. 

And so I started to tinker. I loved the concept of creating tiny scripts that could automate tasks for me. I also took a strong interest in diy raspberry pi projects. 

Having a strong background in mathematics and a new found interested in computer science, I wanted to pursue computer science at university.

### *The Present*
I am currently a undergraduate at Tsinghua University studying computer science. I have experience in mobile development, web development, computer architecture, computer graphics, operating system, and high performance computing. I have worked with all sorts of programming languages, tools, and frameworks throughout my courses. 

### *The Future*
I want to work on software that will help others.
